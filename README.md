# tmux-setup
See below quick start to quickly install `tmux`.

"`tmux` is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same time. It can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals, allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux)
